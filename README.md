# Details of each Simulator
## **ClaustroPhobia**   
The Claustrophobic Patient is afraid of being in a closed room. So, In this Simulation, the User is placed in a closed room, having no windows and no door. The person can move inside the room but can't go outside. The room size also starts to decrease with time. Chillax!! , it will not Crush you. The settings regarding this can be set by the User in the settings menu. All the data on how long a person stayed in the room, how many times the wall moved, and on what settings will be saved on pressing the back button. This data can be seen by pressing ***status icon***. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72307020/153742762-377a6d8a-86b6-454e-b5b3-d7d9a9695e6b.png" width="20" height="20">

#### <ins>Terms used:</ins>  
***Speed of Wall:*** It is how fast walls will move towards the person.  
***Wall Move After:*** It is the time duration after which the wall starts to move.  
***Wall Move Duration:*** It is time duration for which wall moves and then stops after that.

## **AquaPhobia**   
In this Simulation, the User is landed on an Island(surrounded by water all around).The person can move on the Island, but can't inside the Water.The person will not go inside the water, but the water level increases with Time,hmm....Relax, it is safe.The User can set the settings regarding this in settings menu. All the data on how long person stayed in-game and on what settings will be saved on pressing back button. Again, this data can be seen by pressing ***status icon***. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72307020/153742762-377a6d8a-86b6-454e-b5b3-d7d9a9695e6b.png" width="20" height="20">

#### <ins>Terms used:</ins>  
***Water Rise Rate:*** It is same as "speed of wall", but this time water will rise with this speed.  
***Water Rise After:*** It is the same as "Wall Move After" but water will rise after this time duration.\
***Wall Rise Duration:***  It is the same as "Wall Move Duration",but, this time water will rise for this time duration.

## **AcroPhobia**   
This is my Favorite Part :) In this Simulation, the User has a Hoverboard(This is my first Project,So, don't Expect much :/  ).Initially, it has a height. You will neither fall from Hoverboard nor fall below that height. The person has to see downwards.The idea is that if the person doesn't see downward for a given *wait time* duration, then the Hoverboard moves downwards, and on seeing down for a particular Time, it goes up.The wait time changes on reaching some particular Level. There is a max reach level, after which you find something interesting :) The settings regarding Initial *Wait Time* and *Still Focus Time* can be set by the User in settings menu. All the data on how long a person stayed in-game, Max Height Reached, and on what settings will be saved on pressing the back button. Again, this data can be seen by pressing ***status icon***. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72307020/153742762-377a6d8a-86b6-454e-b5b3-d7d9a9695e6b.png" width="20" height="20">


#### <ins>Terms used:</ins>  
***Wait Time:*** It is how long a person can stay without looking down.  
***Still Focus Time:*** It is how long a person has to see downwards for going upwards.\
***Fall Focus Time:*** It is the same as Still Focus Time, but it comes into play when HoverBoard falls or goes downwards. Its value is Fixed 0.6 sec.
